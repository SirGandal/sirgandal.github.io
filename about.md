# Hi, I'm Sergio

I am Software Engineer based in Victoria in beautiful British Columbia. Recipient of a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Software Engineering from the Polytechnic University of Milan, I love building things from scratch by turning music and coffee into code.

When I am not writing code, you will find me on a squash court hitting the ball, somewhere around the city snapping pictures or at home cooking a fancy meal, italian of course.
